# SMART RESUME ANALYZER

An AI-powered system that automates resume screening and initial interview processes — built with NLP, ML, and intelligent automation.

# **🚀 Project Overview**
Recruiters often face a flood of applications, making resume screening slow, biased, and inefficient. Smart Resume Analyzer tackles this problem by:

Parsing resumes to extract essential data

Using NLP & ML to evaluate candidate suitability

Automating interview scheduling and voice-based interactions

This system streamlines recruitment while ensuring fairness, speed, and deeper insights for better hiring decisions.

# **🧠 Features**
✅ Resume Parsing using NLP
✅ AI-based Candidate Evaluation
✅ Automated Interview Scheduling with IVR
✅ Speech-to-Text Conversion + NLP Analysis
✅ Recruiter Dashboard with Resume Upload & Result View
✅ Scoring & Ranking System for Applicants
✅ Secure, Scalable Web Interface

📚 Literature Survey Highlights
We referred to multiple IEEE papers to design an effective resume analysis pipeline using:

TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity for matching

KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, and BERT for classification

NER (spaCy/NLTK) for entity extraction

Transformer models (like GPT, BERT) for contextual understanding

Studies showed accuracy rates up to 99.45% using hybrid techniques combining NER + DRNN + collaborative filtering.
