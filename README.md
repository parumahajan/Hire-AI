# SMART RESUME ANALYZER

An AI-powered system that automates resume screening and initial interview processes â€” built with NLP, ML, and intelligent automation.

# **ðŸš€ Project Overview**
ðŸ”¹Recruiters often face a flood of applications, making resume screening slow, biased, and inefficient. Smart Resume Analyzer tackles this problem by:

ðŸ”¹Parsing resumes to extract essential data

ðŸ”¹Using NLP & ML to evaluate candidate suitability

ðŸ”¹Automating interview scheduling and voice-based interactions

ðŸ”¹This system streamlines recruitment while ensuring fairness, speed, and deeper insights for better hiring decisions.

# **ðŸ§  Features**
âœ… Resume Parsing using NLP
âœ… AI-based Candidate Evaluation
âœ… Automated Interview Scheduling with IVR
âœ… Speech-to-Text Conversion + NLP Analysis
âœ… Recruiter Dashboard with Resume Upload & Result View
âœ… Scoring & Ranking System for Applicants
âœ… Secure, Scalable Web Interface

ðŸ“š Literature Survey Highlights
We referred to multiple IEEE papers to design an effective resume analysis pipeline using:

ðŸ”¹TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity for matching

ðŸ”¹KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, and BERT for classification

ðŸ”¹NER (spaCy/NLTK) for entity extraction

ðŸ”¹Transformer models (like GPT, BERT) for contextual understanding

ðŸ”¹Studies showed accuracy rates up to 99.45% using hybrid techniques combining NER + DRNN + collaborative filtering.
